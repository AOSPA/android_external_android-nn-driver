------ ArmNN for Android NNAPI supported operations ------

This release of ArmNN for Android supports use as a driver for the Android Neural Networks API. It implements the
android.hardware.neuralnetworks@1.0, android.hardware.neuralnetworks@1.1 and android.hardware.neuralnetworks@1.2
HAL interfaces.

For more information on the Android Neural Networks API, see https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks/index.html

For integration and usage documentation, please see README.md.

--- Unsupported operators ---

The following AndroidNN HAL 1.0 operations are currently not supported:

DEPTH_TO_SPACE
EMBEDDING_LOOKUP
HASHTABLE_LOOKUP
LSH_PROJECTION
RNN
SVDF

The following AndroidNN HAL 1.2 operations are currently not supported:

CONCATENATION
LSTM
MINIMUM
PAD_V2
QUANTIZE
QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM
TRANSPOSE_CONV_2D

Where operations are not supported by the ArmNN Android NN Driver, the driver indicates this to the framework
appropriately and the framework implements those operations using a CPU implementation.
